### CPSC 120

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-medrian-and-bruce) 
Lab 6 part 1 was an interesting lab to do. It was different from the labs before. It was kind of fun trying to get the pattern we had to get, I even still remember when I caused an infinite loop to happen and I was shocked, not knowing what to do but Iâ€™m glad we were able to finish it.

Lab 6 part 2 was also interesting to me. I liked the idea of a secret number guessing game program. This was a good lab to be practicing different kinds of loops and if statements.

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-bruce-and-medrian)
Lab 5 part 3 was also interesting. I never knew much about the blackjack game but I liked the idea of making the program. A lot of loops and if statements were used here so this was good practice for that.
